This project is the in-progress source code for the future website of the Greater Los Angeles Area Mensa (GLAAM).  Built with TypeScript, React, [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), this project aims to replace [the current GLAAM website](https://www.glaam.org/) with a faster, simpler, and more engaging platformâ€”designed to better serve members and appeal to prospective ones.  The project is still in its early stages; however, I hope to eventually welcome contributions from other Mensans as well as public volunteers.

<!-- ## Getting Started -->

<!-- First, run the development server: -->

<!-- ```bash -->
<!-- npm run dev -->
<!-- # or -->
<!-- yarn dev -->
<!-- # or -->
<!-- pnpm dev -->
<!-- # or -->
<!-- bun dev -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. -->

<!-- You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file. -->

<!-- This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel. -->

<!-- ## Learn More -->

<!-- To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources: -->

<!-- - [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API. -->
<!-- - [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial. -->

<!-- You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome! -->

<!-- ## Deploy on Vercel -->

<!-- The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js. -->

<!-- Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details. -->
